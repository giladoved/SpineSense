# SpineSense

*SpineSense* is a wearable technology designed to mitigate chronic back problems. It uses the Arduino along with several other sensors. This is the code to alert the user when their back is out of position. Hopefully soon it will be an autonomous replacement to physical therapy. Hardware still under further development.
